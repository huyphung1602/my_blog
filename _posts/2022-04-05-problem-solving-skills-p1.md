A quick note of [Grokking Techtalk #44 - Problem-Solving Skills for SWE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehedAfyb-9Y)

This note is not cover the whole tech talk content. It is just a quick note to highlight the important points. It is useful when you already listened to the tech talk.

## Who has the problem?

The stakeholders:

- Clients are the people who buy your product, or solution.
- Users are the people who use your product directly.

## What is the problem?

A problem contains two components:

- The **expected** reality of the stakeholders.
- The **perceived** reality of the stakeholders.

Solving the problem is filling the gap between the realities.

## Problem definition

To define the problem we have to answer these questions?

- What is the problem?
  - What is perceived reality?
  - What is the expected reality? Is it clear?
- Who is involved in the problem?
- How important is the problem?
- When does the problem needs to be solved?
- Is there really a problem?

**Principle:** Problem definition should be at the highest abstraction level that appropriately describes the situation.

## Causal Analysis

Knowing what causes the problem.

- Draw a causal diagram to define the causes.
- Draw the casual loop diagram to learn the non-linear casual relationship. (**System Thinking** concept).
- Ishikawa diagram.

## Common mistakes

- Forget that problem is inherently a human thing.
- Forget to choose the right problem to solve.
