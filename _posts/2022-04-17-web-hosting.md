Web hosting is an online service that allows you to publish your website files onto the internet. So, anyone who has access to the internet has access to your website.

## Shared Hosting

A single computer will host several websites. Although you'll share resources with other users, you don't have access to their files.
The quality of the service depends on the hosting provider
Easy to find a plan at less than 5$ per month.

## Virtual Private Server Hosting

A single physical server will contain multiple virtually-partitioned sections.
Works as a full system. You have dedicated resources. In some cases, you could access that server's configuration.
The site performance can still be affected by other sites on the server.

## Cloud hosting

It means many computers are working together.
You can easily scale your sever's resources as needed
The resources that are being used are spread across several servers, reducing the change of any downtime due to server malfunction.

## Dedicated Server Hosting

The physical server is rented by you. Your website is the only one stored on it.
You have full root and admin access. So, you can control everything from the security to the operating system that you run.
Dedicated servers are basically the top-of-the-line options. Price could go up from 100$ per month.

## Managed Hosting

The hosting companies provide technical services such as hardware and software setup and configuration, maintenance, hardware replacement, technical support, and patching.
The provider takes care of the day-to-day management of the hardware, operating systems, and standardized applications.

## Colocation

Colocation hosting is similar to dedicated hosting, with one notable exception.
In colocation hosting, the companies own their hardware but are looking to augment its usefulness by renting server space in a colocation center.
The center will provide the power, bandwidth, IP address, and cooling systems that your server requires. Space is rented out in racks and cabinets.
